- storybook: Provides a storybook setup for interactive component development and testing.

2. Component Relationships and Interactions:

- The app module is the central part of the system and contains submodules for different features and functionality.
- The app/components module contains reusable UI components used across the application.
- The app/screens module contains the main screen components for different user roles (Player, Tactical, Medical, Management).
- The app/navigation module handles the navigation flow and routing between screens.
- The app/services module provides various services for API communication, caching, and reactotron integration.
- The app/hooks module contains custom hooks for managing state and side effects in functional components.
- The app/redux module contains the redux store setup and slices for managing application state.
- The app/utils module contains utility functions used across the application.
- The app/i18n module handles internationalization and localization.
- The app/theme module defines the application's visual theme and styling.
- The storybook module is used for developing and testing UI components in isolation.

3. Data Flow between Components:

- Data flow in the application follows a unidirectional pattern using props and callbacks.
- Parent components pass data and callbacks to child components via props.
- Child components communicate with parent components by invoking the provided callbacks.
- The redux store is used for managing global application state and is accessed using hooks (useSelector, useDispatch) in functional components.
- API services are used to fetch and update data from remote servers.
- The cache manager is used to cache API responses for improved performance.

4. Design Patterns Used:

- The system follows a modular architecture pattern with a clear separation of concerns.
- The component-based architecture is used for building reusable UI components.
- The hooks pattern is used for managing state and side effects in functional components.
- The redux pattern is used for managing global application state.
- The navigation pattern is used for handling navigation and routing between screens.
- The service pattern is used for encapsulating API communication and other external dependencies.

5. Key Architectural Decisions:

- The decision to use a modular architecture allows for better maintainability, scalability, and code reuse.
- The use of react-native and react-navigation enables cross-platform mobile app development.
- The integration of redux for state management provides a centralized and predictable way to manage application state.
- The use of storybook facilitates the development and testing of UI components in isolation.
- The separation of API services and caching logic improves performance and maintainability.

6. System Boundaries and Interfaces:

- The system interacts with external APIs through the API services defined in the app/services/api module.
- The cache manager (app/services/cache) acts as an interface between the API services and the application, providing caching functionality.
- The reactotron service (app/services/reactotron) provides an interface for debugging and monitoring the application.
- The navigation module (app/navigation) defines the navigation flow and screen transitions within the application.
- The i18n module (app/i18n) provides an interface for internationalization and localization.

This architecture documentation provides an overview of the system structure, component relationships, data flow, design patterns, key decisions, and system boundaries. It aims to facilitate understanding and maintenance of the codebase.
